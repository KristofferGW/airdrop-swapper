# airdrop-swapper
The site is live on https://token-telescope.onrender.com/

I made this to automate the process of finding a place to swap tokens while positioning myself for a potential airdrop at the same time.

To help me get a good spread across all airdrops I want to position myself for, the results are shown in random order. Extra weight in probability is given to protocols I believe will have good airdrops.
